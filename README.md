# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Usage

I created a basic responsive portfolio page using bootstrap with a blurb about me and some faux images as well as a contacts page. The project required three pages that one can navigate through using navigation bar. From the main header on the right-hand side, the viewer is able to access my portfolio which should lead to a gallery of images with text written across. The contacts page should take the viewer to a page layout in which you are able to leave a name, e-mail, and message for correspondence.The web page is supposed to be responsive, shrinking and growing as the browser page moves. The images in the gallery should also be responsive.
